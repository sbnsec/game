This is very useful for noting where we are when we work in a particular directory, and want to go there later. Or, simply if we lose track of where we are.\n\nWe should have a pretty good idea of manuveuring around the file system by now, and seeing what files and subdirectories are available, and how to move around them, up and down, and even be able to always find out where we are. Also, we have learned about switches, and how they alter the normal behavior of commands so that they can provide other features, that the normal command alone would not offer.\n\nBut, how can we do other stuff we're used to? In the next lesson we'll have a look at file manipulation, such that, we can move, copy, delete, create files and directories.\n",c={history:[],workingDirectory:"/home/user",user:"user",fileSystem:{"/":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home/user":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home/user/Desktop":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home/user/Documents":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home/user/Documents/cat_explained.txt":{type:"file",modified:Date.now(),content:s},"/home/user/Documents/cd_explained.txt":{type:"file",modified:Date.now(),content:i},"/home/user/Documents/filesystems_explained.txt":{type:"file",modified:Date.now(),content:a},"/home/user/Documents/Homework":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home/user/Documents/Homework/labOne.txt":{type:"file",modified:Date.now(),content:"TODO"},"/home/user/Downloads":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home/user/Music":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home/user/Pictures":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home/user/Videos":{type:"dir",modified:Date.now()},"/home/user/ls_explained.txt":{type:"file",modified:Date.now(),content:r},"/home/user/pwd_explained.txt":{type:"file",modified:Date.now(),content:l},"/home/user/.hidden.txt":{type:"file",modified:Date.now(),content:"hidden file is empty"}}};e.exports={title:"Creating and Removing of Files and Directories",sections:[{task:"We've learned how to use various commands so far: ls, pwd, cd, cp, mv to name a few, and some commonly used switches.
