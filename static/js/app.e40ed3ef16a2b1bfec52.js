Each book is organized in a particular location on their respective shelves, and would also function as a directory.\n\nTo illustrate how this would work, we will imagine we want to access page 5 from Moby Dick. We have to find it's shelf, it's location on the shelf, and turn to page 5. This could be visualized as such.\n\n/ShelfOne/MobyDick/Page5\n\nRemember, computers don't have any innate knowledge, and need to be told, and explained every single step.\n\nIn this same way, Computers handle files and directory based on their location from the \"root,\" or the source node--or in our example, the shelf.\n\nMost of us are familiar with this already. We have our Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos directory usually setup for us went we originally setup our computer.\n\nNormally, we are accustomed to use modern day GUI operating systems, which handle many of our tasks for us via a file manager. And, in many cases, as we will learn, it's actually better to take a step back to an archaic time of the command line.\n",r="The first command we'll explore is the 'ls' command. The ls command lists the contents of the current directory.\n\nThis is valuable to see what 'we have to work with,' in our current location. Files and directories are typically displayed, as expected. Additionally, however, there are hidden files. ls will not show these files. To see everything, we need to explain switches (or flages).\n\nWe can change the default behavior of an issued command by applying a switch (or flag) to it. This is done by following it with the minus sign and an appropriate letter. For example, if we type the same ls command, as ls -a, invokes the 'a' switch. In this case, the 'a' represents all. So, instead of just listing the default contents of a directory, the ls command now list all files including hidden files, which are no normally displayed.\n\nThere are many flags associated with each command, and we will cover many of the commonly used switches, but not all of them.\n\nThe 'h' switch is useful, because sometimes we want to list the contents in a more human understandable form. The 'h' represents human friendly units, instead of normally arcane information that might sometimes be listed.\n\nIt's often useful to see deeper information of the contents of the directory, e.g. owner, permissions associated with the content, last time it was accessed, etc. We can get all this detailed information with the 'l' or long switch in association with the 'ls' command.\n\nWe might want to list the contents of a directory in a single line, separated by a comma. This can be achieved by using the 'm' switch.\n\nWhat is really nice, and helpful, is we might want to see the contents of not a single directory, but all the subdirectories within it, as well. We can do this by using the 'R' switch. If we type 'ls -R' all the subdirectories will open up, into the list contents of those already visible within the folder.\n\nTry that at your local library to view the contents of all the books on a shelf in an instant!\n\nOther popular switches are 't' and '1', one not to be mistaken for little l, show the entries by time and forces them into a single column, respectively.\n\nAnother niceity with the usage of switches is that you can use more than one at a time! For example, you can type: 'ls -aR' to view all the contents of the current working diretory and all it's subdirectories. The only limit, is some switches would be counter-productive, so in some cases, their usage may not be allowed with other switches. But, generally, you can use many switches, to however meet your needs.\n\nOk, so we have a pretty good idea of how we can view content now, but how do move?",l="\nSo now that we can navigate around, and list content of our directories, it's very easy to get lost. How do I find out where I am?\n\nWe can use the 'pwd' command, and it will show us the complete path to our current working directory. This is very useful for noting where we are when we work in a particular directory, and want to go there later. Or, simply if we lose track of where we are.\n\nWe should have a pretty good idea of manuveuring around the file system by now, and seeing what files and subdirectories are available, and how to move around them, up and down, and even be able to always find out where we are. Also, we have learned about switches, and how they alter the normal behavior of commands so that they can provide other features, that the normal command alone would not offer.\n\nBut, how can we do other stuff we're used to?

Each book is organized in a particular location on their respective shelves, and would also function as a directory.\n\nTo illustrate how this would work, we will imagine we want to access page 5 from Moby Dick. We have to find it's shelf, it's location on the shelf, and turn to page 5. This could be visualized as such.\n\n/ShelfOne/MobyDick/Page5\n\nRemember, computers don't have any innate knowledge, and need to be told, and explained every single step.\n\nIn this same way, Computers handle files and directory based on their location from the \"root,\" or the source node--or in our example, the shelf.\n\nMost of us are familiar with this already. We have our Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos directory usually setup for us went we originally setup our computer.\n\nNormally, we are accustomed to use modern day GUI operating systems, which handle many of our tasks for us via a file manager. And, in many cases, as we will learn, it's actually better to take a step back to an archaic time of the command line.",r="The first command we'll explore is the 'ls' command. The ls command lists the contents of the current directory.\n\nThis is valuable to see what 'we have to work with,' in our current location. Files and directories are typically displayed, as expected. Additionally, however, there are hidden files. ls will not show these files. To see everything, we need to explain switches (or flages).\n\nWe can change the default behavior of an issued command by applying a switch (or flag) to it. This is done by following it with the minus sign and an appropriate letter. For example, if we type the same ls command, as ls -a, invokes the 'a' switch. In this case, the 'a' represents all. So, instead of just listing the default contents of a directory, the ls command now list all files including hidden files, which are no normally displayed.\n\nThere are many flags associated with each command, and we will cover many of the commonly used switches, but not all of them.\n\nThe 'h' switch is useful, because sometimes we want to list the contents in a more human understandable form. The 'h' represents human friendly units, instead of normally arcane information that might sometimes be listed.\n\nIt's often useful to see deeper information of the contents of the directory, e.g. owner, permissions associated with the content, last time it was accessed, etc. We can get all this detailed information with the 'l' or long switch in association with the 'ls' command.\n\nWe might want to list the contents of a directory in a single line, separated by a comma. This can be achieved by using the 'm' switch.\n\nWhat is really nice, and helpful, is we might want to see the contents of not a single directory, but all the subdirectories within it, as well. We can do this by using the 'R' switch. If we type 'ls -R' all the subdirectories will open up, into the list contents of those already visible within the folder.\n\nTry that at your local library to view the contents of all the books on a shelf in an instant!\n\nOther popular switches are 't' and '1', one not to be mistaken for little l, show the entries by time and forces them into a single column, respectively.\n\nAnother niceity with the usage of switches is that you can use more than one at a time! For example, you can type: 'ls -aR' to view all the contents of the current working diretory and all it's subdirectories. The only limit, is some switches would be counter-productive, so in some cases, their usage may not be allowed with other switches. But, generally, you can use many switches, to however meet your needs.\n\nOk, so we have a pretty good idea of how we can view content now, but how do move?",l="So now that we can navigate around, and list content of our directories, it's very easy to get lost. How do I find out where I am?\n\nWe can use the 'pwd' command, and it will show us the complete path to our current working directory. This is very useful for noting where we are when we work in a particular directory, and want to go there later. Or, simply if we lose track of where we are.\n\nWe should have a pretty good idea of manuveuring around the file system by now, and seeing what files and subdirectories are available, and how to move around them, up and down, and even be able to always find out where we are. Also, we have learned about switches, and how they alter the normal behavior of commands so that they can provide other features, that the normal command alone would not offer.\n\nBut, how can we do other stuff we're used to? In the next lesson we'll have a look at file manipulation, such that, we can move, copy, delete, create files and directories.",c='The mkdir command create directories. It stands for "MaKe DIRectory." It is the fundamental computer operation of creating a folder, and used to create storage directories for our different types of data.\n\nAn important component of directories has to do with ownership, but is not within the scope of this tutorial. That will be developed in the future. Stay tuned.',d="Here we will discuss both the rm and rmdir commands, because of their similarity and overlap.\n\nThe rm command is used for removing files. Be careful with it's use, there is no undo command. When you use the rm filename, you delete filename without question. Theoretically, it would be possible to recover the information, via additional software -- if done relatively immediately after the deletion.\n\nJust like with modern GUIs, the rm command 'unlinks' the file, meaning it is not accessible anymore by the system. However, the file is not technically 'deleted.' To completely remove a file, you would want to use the shred command, but that is outside the scope of this tutorial.\n\nAlso, the rm command by default does not work on directories. To delete directories, you would need to use the recursive switch:\n\nrm -R directory\n\nAnother alternative to delete a directory would be to use the rmdir command, which is specifically designed to delete directories.\n\nSo, in summation, you can delete a file by using the rm command, and delete directories by using rm -R dirName or rmdir dirName.",u="The touch command is a very commonly used command for creating empty folders.\n\nThe command changes the timestamps of file(s), so if the file already exists, the timestamp data, like when it was last accessed is updated to the current time. For the average computer user, normally, that is not of particularly great importance, but for some administrator or related purposes, it is very important.\n\nAdditionally, what is a bonus feature of this command, if the file does not exist, it is created! The file of course will be empty, but you now have a container to throw stuff into. Many other bash commands only work if something goes into a file. So, often times, you'll need to just create an empty file to throw stuff into. Touch facilities this, by creating a file, as such:\n\ntouch testFile\n\nThe testFile is created!\n\nOf course, if you don't want to create a bunch of empty files, you could use the -c switch, as such:\n\ntouch -c testFile\n\nThis updates the timestamp on testFile, but if it does not exist, the file is not created.",h={
